<h1>Workspace description</h1>

<p><b>We will describe the workspace, describing it in relation to the versions of waveguide antennas we have been building.</b></p>

    Our workspace is an environment of
    5m x 4m, where we have two work tables: 

    * one where we prepare the pipes
    and supports and work with grinder,
    a drill, perforator and electric welder
    * another one where we have the 
    device that holds the wires for
    welding and resining.

<mark>The tools we use are for domestic use, so it would not be very difficult to find them.</mark>

<h3>Personal protective equipment</h3>

<ul>
 <li>
      Hearing protectors
 </li>

      Gloves

<h2>Version 1:</h2>

>In the first stage, the _cutting of the pipes_ and the _cutting and bending of the supports_, we ordered them from a blacksmith's workshop.
 
<h3>In relation to the perforation of the pipes for the cable entry, the mold was a piece of paper that we used as a template.</h3>

<h3>We were working at that time drilling the holes with a <i>hand drill</i>, holding the piece with a <i>drill</i> bit.</h3>

<p><b>For this version, we used a piece of paper with the measurements as a template.</b></p>

<h3>In a first prototype, we used an autogenous soldering machine to hold the wires, soldering a bronze complement to it.</h3>

<h3>Paintwork</h3>

<p>
    <b>The process of finishing the antennas includes, among other things, painting.</b>
</p>


<p><b>At first, we painted with a brush, which delayed the process and did not give good results.</b></p>

<h3>Cable assembly</h3>

<p>
    <b> In our workshop we also build pigtail cables.</b>
</p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F7tCu67.jpg" width="500">

<p><b>We fit the SMA RP male connectors</b></p>

<p>
    <b>To complete the process, they are crimped and heat-shrunk. </b>
</p>

<p>
    <b>At the other end of the cable, we strip the sheath until we obtain the spike that will illuminate the waveguide.</b>
</p>

<p>
    <b>In order for the wires to make contact with the waveguide, they are soldered to the waveguide with a soldering iron. </b>
</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/t3iBxTd.jpg" width="300">

<p><b>To protect the illuminators, the waveguide is closed with a plastic clip.</b></p>

    Support welding:
</h3>

<p><b>The bracket is welded to the waveguide with an electric welder.

<p>
    <b>Part of the process is to file the burrs from the pipes. For this, we use the morza to hold the pipe.</b>
</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/h1u2jv6.jpg" width="400">

<p>
    <b>In some cases the rosin came off the tube and the wires came loose. 
    We then decided to clean the solder area with a rotary brush and re-solder the wire mesh. </b>
</p>

<h3>
    Materials and tools:

</h3>
          
    50x80mm piece of metal, 
    2mm thick, plated to 90'support
    Template
    Punch
    Hammer
    6mm drill bit
    Round and flat file 
    (to remove burrs) 
    Bench drill
    Drill
    Clamp
    Scissors
    Rubber feet




<h2>
    Version 2
</h2>

<h3>
    For this version we built a <i>mold</i> with a plastic cup that allowed us to make the <i>perforations</i> in the waveguide in a more precise way.
</h3>

<p>
    <b>To optimize this task, we purchased a bench drill that allows us to work with more precision and less effort.</b>
</p>

<h3>
    We use as a template a metal support for the perforations of the brackets.

<h3>
    With a painting machine, we were able to optimize the process, obtaining better results in a shorter time.

<mark>In this version, the way of holding the wires with a metallic supplement was replaced by another material, epoxy resin. To hold the resin, we used hose and created a device to hold the cables while the resin hardened in the correct position.</mark>
