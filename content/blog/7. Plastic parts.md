<h1>
    Plastic parts
</h1>


<p>
    
The possibility of accessing 3D printing as a resource enabled us to create our own molds (tooling) to facilitate the production process, as well as to build inputs for the waveguides.

Initially, the plastic parts arose from the need to replace the plastic lids used as lids with 3D printed plastic lids.

Seeing the potential of 3D printing, we designed a prototype of a portachain to hold the antenna cables, as well as molds to facilitate the drilling of the waveguide pipes.
    The current portachain allows us to replace procedures such as welding or resining, shortening production times and costs as well. The process to arrive at these designs and the different previous prototypes are recorded  <a href="https://tdr.libre.org.ar/6-prototipado">here</a>.
    This research process involved familiarizing ourselves with the design tools in Freecad and practice with the printer. Currently we are about to access a training course at the UTN (National Technical University) to perfect the prints.

Our first <a href="https://github.com/TecnologiadeRaiz/LoPALiR/blob/main/Partes%20plasticas/Tapas/TAPA-v1.FCStd">design</a> allowed us to improve the performance of the antenna, since the plastic strips that we used as a cover interfered with the waveguide signal.

This <a href="https://github.com/TecnologiadeRaiz/LoPALiR/blob/main/MOLDE%20DE%20PERFORACION%20GUIA%20DE%20ONDAS-v2.FCStd">design</a> gives us precision when drilling holes in the waveguide, speeding up the production process.

<p>
The possibility of designing <a href="https://github.com/TecnologiadeRaiz/LoPALiR/tree/main/Partes%20plasticas/PORTACHAIN">these parts</a> allowed us to optimize the way of fastening the cables, which was a challenge in the previous prototypes, meaning higher cost and production times.

The first design was fragile because the material we used, PLA filament, was not suitable for the antennas, as they are exposed to sun, rain and wind.

    The second version of the portachain was designed taking into account the increased thickness of the part to give it more solvency, and the material, which was replaced by PETG filament.

    The first designs did not allow us to hold the cables as expected.

Then we realized that in order to give it a better finish and a better grip, we had to attach a 3/8 crimped aluminum pipe ring to the cable holder, thus providing the expected firmness to hold the cables.
