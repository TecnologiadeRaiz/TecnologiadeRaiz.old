    Plastic parts

<p>
    
The possibility of accessing 3D printing as a resource enabled us to create our own molds (tooling) to facilitate the production process, as well as to build inputs for the waveguides.

Initially, the plastic parts arose from the need to replace the plastic lids used as lids with 3D printed plastic lids.

Seeing the potential of 3D printing, we designed a prototype of a portachain to hold the antenna cables, as well as molds to facilitate the drilling of the waveguide pipes.

Our first <a href="https://github.com/TecnologiadeRaiz/LoPALiR/blob/main/Partes%20plasticas/Tapas/TAPA-v1.FCStd">design</a> allowed us to improve the performance of the antenna, since the plastic strips that we used as a cover interfered with the waveguide signal.

This <a href="https://github.com/TecnologiadeRaiz/LoPALiR/blob/main/MOLDE%20DE%20PERFORACION%20GUIA%20DE%20ONDAS-v2.FCStd">design</a> gives us precision when drilling holes in the waveguide, speeding up the production process.

The possibility of designing <a href="https://github.com/TecnologiadeRaiz/LoPALiR/tree/main/Partes%20plasticas/PORTACHAIN">these parts</a> allowed us to optimize the way of fastening the cables, which was a challenge in the previous prototypes, meaning higher cost and production times.
