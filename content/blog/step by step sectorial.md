# An idea of how to make the design of your sector antenna

    We thank NlNet and Altermundi for making this project possible. 

*From our reality, we try to create solutions for the development of Hardware in the territories, in an accessible way.* 


*  In the search for an antenna design with optimal gain, easily replicable , we return to the research work that AlterMundi began and sustained to estimate dimensions of the antenna, using a [Waveguide calculator](https://github.com/TecnologiadeRaiz/LoPALiR/blob/6cfcefe5b7c623523bdbc38a3de3d6f52c728e81/circular_waveguide_tuneado.ods), adapted for 5.8 Ghz by Nicol√°s Echaniz

###  This is the foundation on which we build our production experiences and continue to expand research at TDR.
### 


**We work with a free drawing software program for the design of the antennas.**

### As illuminator we use for each chain, a 11.7mm spike of 95/30 coaxial cable from Indeca and a RP-SMA Male connector at the other end.

## We provide the plans to build these antennas.
